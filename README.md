## Synopsis

This repository is for all my config files for things like, vim, autohotkey, bash and zsh shells, python directory management scripts, python service control scripts, windows annoyances tweaks and log. I can't remember this stuff normally and it changes between machines so this is a dump for each machine

## Code Example

nmap ; :
nmap ; :

## Motivation

I am lazy and can't be arsed remembering how these files should be and then having to go away and relearn all the stuff I learnt before.

## Installation

grab all the files and set them up for vim and ahk etc.
## API Reference

there is no API
## Tests

well chuck _vimrc in your home directory like c:\users\dumbfuck\. then run gvim from windows-r and make sure that c:\program files (x86)\vim\vim74 is in your path. you can do it from the command line if you type 'setx path "%path%;c:/program files (x86)/vim/vim74"'

that should work, unless you are using the non-64bit version of windows, or linux, or osx, or chromeos or amigaos
